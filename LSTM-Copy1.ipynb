    "## Making training mini-batches\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where we'll make our mini-batches for training. Remember that we want our batches to be multiple sequences of some desired number of sequence steps. Considering a simple example, our batches would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/sequence_batching@1x.png\" width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We have our text encoded as integers as one long array in `encoded`. Let's create a function that will give us an iterator for our batches. I like using [generator functions](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/) to do this. Then we can pass `encoded` into this function and get our batch generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is discard some of the text so we only have completely full batches. Each batch contains $N \\times M$ characters, where $N$ is the batch size (the number of sequences) and $M$ is the number of steps. Then, to get the number of batches we can make from some array `arr`, you divide the length of `arr` by the batch size. Once you know the number of batches and the batch size, you can get the total number of characters to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we need to split `arr` into $N$ sequences. You can do this using `arr.reshape(size)` where `size` is a tuple containing the dimensions sizes of the reshaped array. We know we want $N$ sequences (`n_seqs` below), let's make that the size of the first dimension. For the second dimension, you can use `-1` as a placeholder in the size, it'll fill up the array with the appropriate data for you. After this, you should have an array that is $N \\times (M * K)$ where $K$ is the number of batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have this array, we can iterate through it to get our batches. The idea is each batch is a $N \\times M$ window on the array. For each subsequent batch, the window moves over by `n_steps`. We also want to create both the input and target arrays. Remember that the targets are the inputs shifted over one character. You'll usually see the first input character used as the last target character, so something like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y[:, :-1], y[:, -1] = x[:, 1:], x[:, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `x` is the input batch and `y` is the target batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I like to do this window is use `range` to take steps of size `n_steps` from $0$ to `arr.shape[1]`, the total number of steps in each sequence. That way, the integers you get from `range` always point to the start of a batch, and each window is `n_steps` wide."

    "Now we can put all the pieces together and build a class for the network. To actually run data through the LSTM cells, we will use [`tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/api_docs/python/tf/nn/dynamic_rnn). This function will pass the hidden and cell states across LSTM cells appropriately for us. It returns the outputs for each LSTM cell at each step for each sequence in the mini-batch. It also gives us the final LSTM state. We want to save this state as `final_state` so we can pass it to the first LSTM cell in the the next mini-batch run. For `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`, we pass in the cell and initial state we get from `build_lstm`, as well as our input sequences. Also, we need to one-hot encode the inputs before going into the RNN. "
